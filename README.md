# GP4IEQ_spatiotemporal

**GP4IEQ_spatiotemporal** is a public repository dedicated to exploring and modeling spatiotemporal data using Gaussian Processes (GPs). The project focuses on applications in Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), leveraging advanced GP techniques to analyze and predict environmental variables across space and time.

This repository provides Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and scripts for reproducible research and experimentation.
